# Front-End-Project
This is a front end project for an anime based API. You will be able to search for any anime with some suggestions for good ones to watch!
I started this project by setting up the html and css pages first because i knew that was my strong suit. I then spent the 2nd day on the DOM and API
Below are the goals i tried to achieve step-by-step. 
-----------------------------------------
Add a searchbar in the middle of the page
Use a click event on it
Put in my api
Should pull up suggesstions, so thats a library
Show a preview of the animes
Should load the selected anime on the page without refreshing
